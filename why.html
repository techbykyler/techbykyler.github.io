            <h2>Why I prefer dogs over cats</h2>
            <p> I prefer dogs over cats because dogs are most likely considered superior to cats because of their trainability, loyalty, and active nature, which promotes exercise and social interaction for their owners. Dogs are known for their eagerness to please and their ability to learn commands, making them great companions for various activities. Their inherent loyalty and protective instincts also make them valuable family members. Furthermore, dogs' need for walks and playtime encourages a more active lifestyle for their owners, fostering a healthier relationship. Dogs are generally considered to be more loyal and affectionate than cats, and they make great companions for families with children. Cats, on the other hand, are more independent and require less attention and exercise than dogs, making them a great choice for people who work long hours or live in small apartments. Also dogs are friendlier and more loving than cats - they actually want their humans around for more than the food they provide. Cats will have you lazing around all day, whereas dogs will keep you active and social, getting you out and about for walkies and chats with other pet parents.  </p>
