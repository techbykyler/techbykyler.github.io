            <h2>Why I prefer dogs over cats</h2>
            <p> I prefer dogs over cats because dogs are superior companions due to their trainability, loyalty, and ability to enrich human lives, offering active companionship, protection, and a strong emotional bond through their enthusiasm and happiness. Things that cats enjoy is sleeping and roaming on their own free will and only like to played with at times. On the other hand dogs like to play with their owner and younger kids love to play with dogs and it has a lot of interest to play with its owner.  </p>
